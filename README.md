# Introduction to Python Version 2
## Creating an application to send and receive secret messages

In this project, you will learn how to make your own encryption program using Python (that is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming) to send and receive secret messages with a friend. 

In this project you will also learn programming concepts as:

- Iteration (looping) over a string variable;
- The find() method;
- The modulus operator (%).
- **for** loops;

This project introduces iteration (looping) over a text string.

## Prerequisites

Before get on with it to successfully complete this tutorial in a Microsoft Windows Operating System, you must do the following:

    1.- Download and install the [Visual Studio Code](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534107) for Windows.
	
	2.- Install a version of Python 3 (for which this tutorial is written). Options include:
        A download from (python.org)[https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5.exe]

    3.- Install the extension from the (VS Code marketplace)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python]
	
	4.- Make sure the location of your Python interpreter is included in your PATH environment variable. You can check this by running path at the command prompt. If the Python interpreter's folder is not included, open Windows Settings, search for "environment", select Edit environment variables for your account, then edit the Path variable to include that folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Python36-32).
	
## Time to start coding!
