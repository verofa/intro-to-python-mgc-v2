# Introduction to Python Version 2
## Creating an application to send and receive secret messages

In this project, you will learn how to make your own encryption program using Python (that is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming) to send and receive secret messages with a friend. 

In this project you will also learn programming concepts as:

- Iteration (looping) over a string variable;
- The find() method;
- The modulus operator (%).
- **for** loops;

## Prerequisites

Before get on with it to successfully complete this tutorial in a Microsoft Windows Operating System, you must do the following:

1.- Download and install the [Visual Studio Code](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534107) for Windows.

2.- Install a version of Python 3 (for which this tutorial is written), download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/python-3.6.5.exe)

3.- Install the extension from the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

4.- Make sure the location of your Python interpreter is included in your **PATH** environment variable. You can check this by running **path** at the command prompt. If the Python interpreter's folder is not included, open Windows Settings, search for "environment", select Edit environment variables for your account, then edit the Path variable to include that folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\Python36-32).
	
## Time to start coding!

### Step 1 - Understanding the Caesar cipher method or algorithm for performing encryption or decryption of a message.

The Caesar cipher is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encrypting a message, and its name come from Julius Caesar that was popular leader of the Roman Republic. 

A cipher is a type of secret code, where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters shifted up or down (key) in the alphabet.

### Step 2 - Encrypting letters.

Let’s start by encrypting the letter **'E'** using a left shift of 3 as the key (but you can use any number you like), so that (for example) each occurrence of **E** in the plaintext becomes **B**.

### Step 3 - Encrypting letters using Python.

Create a file in Visual Studio Code, name it 'main.py' and write it out as an alphabet variable.

![alphabet-variable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verofa/intro-to-python-mgc-v2/master/alphabet.PNG)

Keep in mind that each letter of the alphabet has a position, starting at position 0. So the letter ‘a’ is at position 0 of the alphabet, ‘b’ is at position 1, ‘c’ is at position 2 and so on.

![alphabet-number-position](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/secret-messages/images/messages-array.png)

Let's see how we can get a specific letter from your variable **alphabet**, for example, if you want to "extract" the letter 'c' write below the declaration of the alphabet variable the following code :

```python
print(alphabet[2])
```

It should look more or less like this:

![Printing-letter-c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verofa/intro-to-python-mgc-v2/master/Printing-letter-c.PNG)

Now it is time to know what those two lines are doing. It is simple to run 'main.py' with Python. Right-click in the editor and select **Run Python File in Terminal** (which saves the file automatically ;) ):

![Executing-Code-VSC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verofa/intro-to-python-mgc-v2/master/Executing-Code-VSC.gif)

Add the following lines to your code:

```python
print(alphabet[8])
print(alphabet[0])
print(alphabet[14])
```

What is it the output? (You can delete the print statements once you have tried this out)

At this point you have learned how to work with an array (the values that store the variable **alphabet**) and extract the value that you want to use from it. Therefore, the next step to encrypt your message is to choose and configure the key you will need to encrypt your messages. For doing that, you will need to store the secret key in a variable as well:

```python
alphabet='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
key = 3
```

Now you are ready to make your first program to encrypt a letter, adding the following lines to your code.

This line, is to ask to the person that is using the program (called **user**) to enter a character (single letter):
```python 
character = input('Please enter a character: ')
```

Then you have to calculate the position of that character, using the method **find** and then you are going to print it in the screen to know its value as shown bellow:

```python
position = alphabet.find(character)
print(position)
```

In the following example, the user is entering the character 'e' and the program is showing the position 4 as a result of the execution of it :

![Encrypting-character](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verofa/intro-to-python-mgc-v2/master/Encrypting-character.gif)

Now that you know the position of the original character (letter) to encrypt it, you should add the **key** (remember its value is 3) to that position creating a new variable (**newPosition**) to store the position of the encrypted character.

```python
newPosition = position + key
```

![Encrypting-character-np](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verofa/intro-to-python-mgc-v2/master/Encrypting-character-np.gif)

In the example above, letter ‘e’ is at position 4. To encrypt it, you add the key (3), giving 7 as the new position that will be used to encrypt the character (that correspond to the letter 'h'). But what happens when you try to get the new position of the letter ‘z’?

![Encrypting-character-z](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verofa/intro-to-python-mgc-v2/master/Encrypting-character-z.gif)

Notice how the newPosition is **28**, and there are not **28** letters in the alphabet!, so sort it out you can use a **%** to tell the **new position** to go back to position 0 once it gets to position **26**.

```python
alphabet='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
key = 3

character = input('Please enter a character: ')
position = alphabet.find(character)
print(position)
newPosition = (position + key) % 26
print(newPosition)
```

Now you are almost there yuhu!! :). The last thing that remains to be done is to replace the original character with the new character that have to be associated with the value of the new position. You have to create and add to your code a new variable, for doing it, and to make it simple you will call it **newCharacter**

```python
newCharacter = alphabet[newPosition]
print("The new character is:", newCharacter)
```

Let's see what your program is doing!


![Encrypting-character-e](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verofa/intro-to-python-mgc-v2/master/Encrypting-character-e.gif)

It is almost done, well done! :). The user (or your friend in this case) do not need to know the position of the characters so you can also remove some of your print statements, just printing the new character at the end. What lines number do you need to delete to do it?


### Step 4: Encrypting entire messages with Python

Now that you know how encryption works, it is time to encrypt a entire message using Python, so let's do it!

You have to change a couple of lines of your code to store the entire message and not just one character. Also, add a **for loop** to your code, and **indent** (four spaces before the beginning of each line) the rest of the code so that it is repeated for each character in the message as shown bellow:

```python
alphabet='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
key = 3
newMessage = ''

message = input('Please enter a message: ')

for character in message:
    position = alphabet.find(character)
    newPosition = (position + key) % 26
    newCharacter = alphabet[newPosition]
    print("The new character is: ", newCharacter)
```

What happens when you run your program?

Time to finish your program to encrypt a message ;), for doing that you have to add each encrypted character to your **newMessage** variable adding these lines in your code:

```python
newMessage += newCharacter
print(newMessage)
```

Run your program, should look something like this:


![Encrypting-character-by-character](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verofa/intro-to-python-mgc-v2/master/Encrypting-character-by-character.gif)

You can notice that every time that is encrypting a character is also printing part of the message, if you just want to see the final message you have to delete the spaces before the last print statement, like this, the encrypted message will only be displayed once at the end. 

You can also delete (or comment using the **#** at the beggining of the line) the code for printing the character positions and add to the last print statement a phrase to know it correspond to the new message, like this:

```python
alphabet='abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
key = 3
newMessage = ''

message = input('Please enter a message: ')

for character in message:
    position = alphabet.find(character)
    newPosition = (position + key) % 26
    newCharacter = alphabet[newPosition]
    #print("The new character is: ", newCharacter)
    newMessage += newCharacter
print('The new encrypted message is: ', newMessage)
```

Congratulations! now you can encrypt messages to chat with your friends using secret messages using your own program in Python!

## Challenge: Encrypting and decrypting messages

This is just the beginning, now that you know how to encrypt some messages, make  your own program to decrypt it.
Good luck and never stop learning, because learning is the ability to understand how everything around you works (and also how to encrypt and decrypt messages :) )
